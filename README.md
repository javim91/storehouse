# Storehouse

This project pretends to be an easy app to manage an storehouse where the person in charge have to update the list of Providers and Products. This two main data are the bases for create Purchase Orders and some few stuff that will come as soon as possible :).

# Technology

About the technology that uses, it's an application made with Vue3 (frontend) that supports (of course) options Api and composition Api. Now is a mix, but the intention is to change all to composition Api.

By the simplicity of the app it runs directly with Google Firestore as non-relational database.
